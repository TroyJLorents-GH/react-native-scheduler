# Native MapKit Search Module Setup

## Overview
This guide explains how to complete the native iOS MapKit search module to get true Apple Maps functionality in your React Native app.

## Current Status
✅ **Created the module structure**
✅ **Updated AppleMapView to use the module**
✅ **Added fallback implementation**

## Next Steps to Complete

### 1. Build the Native Module
```bash
cd modules/MapKitSearch
npm install
npm run build
```

### 2. Add to Your App
```bash
# From your app root
npm install ./modules/MapKitSearch
```

### 3. Update app.json
Add the module to your app configuration:
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      "expo-router",
      "expo-maps",
      "./modules/MapKitSearch"
    ]
  }
}
```

### 4. Build for iOS
```bash
npx expo run:ios
```

## What This Gives You

### 🎯 True Apple Maps Experience
- **MKLocalSearch** - Real nearby business search
- **MKLocalSearchCompleter** - Autocomplete suggestions
- **Distance calculations** - Accurate distances from your location
- **Business categories** - Restaurants, gyms, coffee shops, etc.

### 🔍 Search Features
- **"Starbucks Nearby"** - Shows actual nearby Starbucks locations
- **Distance display** - "0.9 miles away", "2,500 ft away"
- **Business names** - Real business names and addresses
- **Categories** - Coffee shops, gyms, restaurants, etc.

### 🗺️ Map Integration
- **Red pins** for search results
- **Green pin** for selected location
- **Automatic zoom** to search area
- **Directions integration** with Apple Maps

## Current Fallback
The current implementation uses basic geocoding as a fallback. Once you complete the native module setup, you'll get:

- ✅ **Real business search** instead of basic geocoding
- ✅ **Accurate distances** from your location
- ✅ **Business categories** and rich data
- ✅ **Autocomplete suggestions** like Apple Maps

## Troubleshooting

### Module Not Found
If you get "Cannot find module" errors:
1. Make sure you've built the module: `npm run build`
2. Check that the module is properly linked
3. Restart your development server

### Build Errors
If you get iOS build errors:
1. Make sure you have Xcode installed
2. Check that the module is added to your app.json
3. Clean and rebuild: `npx expo run:ios --clear`

### Search Not Working
If search doesn't work:
1. Check location permissions
2. Verify the module is properly imported
3. Check console for error messages

## Benefits Over Current Implementation

| Feature | Current (Geocoding) | Native MapKit |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| Business Search | ❌ Limited | ✅ Full support |
| Nearby Results | ❌ Basic | ✅ Real nearby |
| Distance | ❌ Calculated | ✅ Accurate |
| Categories | ❌ None | ✅ Business types |
| Autocomplete | ❌ None | ✅ Full suggestions |

## Next Steps
1. **Complete the native module build**
2. **Test with real business searches**
3. **Enjoy true Apple Maps functionality!**

This will give you the exact Apple Maps search experience you wanted! 🚀
